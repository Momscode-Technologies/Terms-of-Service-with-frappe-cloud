Terms of Service (ToS) describe the rules and guidelines that govern the use of a software or service provided by a company. The description you provided includes two terms: GNU/General Public License and Momscode Technology Private Limited. Here's an explanation of each term:

GNU/General Public License (GPL):
The GNU General Public License is a widely used open-source software license. It was created by the Free Software Foundation (FSF) and allows users to freely use, modify, and distribute the software covered by the license. The GPL ensures that users have the freedom to access and modify the source code of the software, promoting collaboration and innovation within the open-source community. When software is licensed under the GNU GPL, it means that users have certain rights and obligations, such as providing access to the source code if they distribute or modify the software.

Momscode Technologies Private Limited:
Momscode Technologies Private Limited is likely the name of a company or organization that is associated with the software or service. The company may be the developer, distributor, or provider of the software. The mention of the company's name in relation to the GNU/General Public License could indicate that the software is licensed under the GPL by Momscode Technologies Private Limited.

It's important to note that without more specific information about the software or service and its terms of service, it's difficult to provide a detailed description.
